So the purpose of this repo will be to store the 
leetcode problems that get submited and pass. 
I will just throw them here so I can ponder on them 
anywhere.

I put a shit ton of comments cause the purpose is to understand 
whats under the hood, as to meditate on the code.

Feel free to make a cup of coffe and read away!
